# Why would I use it?

The plugin offers a few key benefits:

1. Organised, structured data is more readily available for export and can be searched efficiently.
2. By moving data out of the WordPress core meta tables, these tables can be more efficient in their own operations.
3. Increased efficiency in database operations frees up system resources increasing scalability of your site/application.
4. Advanced use offers join tables for eligible fields opening up the possibility of relationship-oriented custom SQL queries.
