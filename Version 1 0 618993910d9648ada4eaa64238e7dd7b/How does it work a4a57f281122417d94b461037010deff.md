# How does it work?

The basic process is as follows:

1. The plugin introduces an option on an ACF Field Group’s admin page the allows a site administrator to enable a custom database table for that field group.
2. On Field Group save, a JSON file is generated – this is the table definition.
3. On a subsequent, manually-triggered action, these JSON files are converted to SQL and are then used to create new database tables or modify existing ones. A table map is also generated as part of this process.
4. The plugin uses the generated map to intercept metadata as it is saved and retrieved from the database. If that piece of metadata has a custom table defined for the related object (post, user, custom post type), the data will be stored/retrieved to/from that custom table.
