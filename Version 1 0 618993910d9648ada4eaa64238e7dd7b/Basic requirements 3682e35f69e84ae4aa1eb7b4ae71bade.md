# Basic requirements

The basic requirements for the plugin to function are as follows:

1. PHP version 5.6 (version 7 is recommended)
2. WordPress version 4.9
3. ACF version 5.6.10

### **ACF Local JSON**

Whilst not a requirement, we highly recommend using ACF JSON. Doing so enables you to further reduce the amount of metadata in your core meta tables by disabling ACF field key reference storage.

Enabling ACF JSON is as simple as creating an acf-json directory inside your theme directory. See [https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/resources/local-json/) for further information.
