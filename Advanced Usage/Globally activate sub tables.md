# Globally activate sub tables

It is possible to set a global setting that will enable sub tables on all eligible fields. At the time of writing, the only fields eligible for sub tables are repeaters.

We donâ€™t recommend this as you will have a very large number of database tables but, if you need to, you can use the following:

```php
<?php
// This will enable sub tables on all eligible fields globally. This affects
// table definition generation and can go in your functions.php file or a plugin.
add_filter( 'acfcdt/settings/enable_sub_tables_globally', '__return_true' );
```
