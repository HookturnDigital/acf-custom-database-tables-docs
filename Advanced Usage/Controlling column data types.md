# Controlling column data types

As of version 1.1, it is possible to control the data types of custom database table columns. Controlling the type can
be useful in reducing your database size and increasing the efficiency of your queries.

It's important to note, due to the way databases work, changing the data types on an existing database may result in
data loss where the existing data is not compatible with the new data type. It is critical you back up your database
before implementing any changes.

It's also important to understand the data types you wish to use as you could end up losing data on isert into the
database where the value isn't supported by the type. e.g; using an `int` type to store strings will result a '0' in
your database.

## Some caveats on certain data types

- WordPress' `dbDelta()` function changes `tinytext`, `text`, and `mediumtext` to `longtext` so it is not possible to
  set these formats using the provided filters. To maintain these formats, it would be necessary to run a custom SQL
  statement on the table after table creation. e.g; `ALTER TABLE my_table MODIFY COLUMN my_field mediumtext;`
- Whilst `date` and `datetime` types are fine to use with the `date_picker` field, attempting to use the `year` type on
  a date picker will break. A workaround for this is to use a normal text field and give that the type `date`.

## A high-level overview of controlling data types

Controlling the data types of your custom table columns is a 3-step process:

1. Use PHP filters to modify the data type of the desired fields â€” the callback function/s run **when a field group is
   saved**.
1. Save the relevant field group/s. The new data types will appear in the table JSON configuration files.
1. Run the table update process to apply the new data types to the tables.

## How to filter column data types

You have two possible points of control here to filter column data types. One is a generic filter which you could use to
evaluate the table and field names from within your hooked callback:

```php
<?php
// This is the first of two possible approaches to override the field data type.
// This approach allows you to evaluate the type, table name (unprefixed), and column 
// name to determine what type you would like to return. All columns on all custom 
// tables pass through this filter.
add_filter( 'acfcdt/set_column_data_type', 'xyz_set_column_data_types', 10, 3 );

/**
 * @param string $type The field data type
 * @param string $table_name The table name without the WordPress table prefix
 * @param string $column_name The field/column name
 *
 * @return string
 */
function xyz_set_column_data_types( $type, $table_name, $column_name ) {

	if ( $table_name === 'my_custom_table' ) {
		if ( $column_name === 'field_1' ) {
			return 'varchar(20)';
		}
	}

	if ( $table_name === 'my_other_custom_table' ) {
		switch ( $column_name ) {

			case 'custom_field':
				return 'varchar(50)';

			case 'other_custom_field':
				return 'bigint';
		}
	}

	return $type;
}
```

The other is a dynamic version of the generic filter that allows you to specify which table and field you wish to
modify. This simplifies your callback function at the cost of the ability to evaluate table and field names
programmatically:

```php
<?php
// This is the second of two possible approaches to override the field data type.
// This approach allows you to target a specific table.column. It is simpler to 
// read and only the specific column is passed through making it a bit more 
// economical.
// Note: The table name in the filter does NOT include the WordPress table prefix.
add_filter( 'acfcdt/set_column_data_type/my_custom_table.my_custom_field', 'xyz_set_column_data_type' );

/**
 * @param string $type The field data type
 *
 * @return string
 */
function xyz_set_column_data_type( $type ) {
	return 'varchar(60)';
}
```
